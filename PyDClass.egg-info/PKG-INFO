        ### How to install?
        It's verry simple! You can run:
        ```bash
        pip install git+https://github.com/CeltiumCDev/PyDClass
        ```
         ** ⚠️ Warning! If you have not got git installed, you can install it or use this command: **
        ```bash
        pip install pydclass # Not supported. Comming soon :)
        ```
        -> Using this syntax is certainly easier but is not recommended if you can do the same thing with this one above because we update GitHub more often than PyPi.
        
        ### How to use?
        It's also verry simple!
        
        You must go into your project directory and run
        ```bash
        pydclass <you module>
        ```
        A web server will be started on the port "8080", you can go here!
        
        ## FAQ
        
        * **Why inherited attributes appear and not inherited methods?** Why not? No I'm kidding! We are in the process of fixing this.
        * **Is there Windows or Mac support?** Yes for Mac, not for Windows.
        * **Is the program compatible with Python2?** Maybe, but it's not designed for that.
